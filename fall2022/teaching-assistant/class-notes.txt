divide in conquer


By the end of this lab students will be able to define elastic deformation and plastic deformation. 

by the end of this class students will be able to look and a stress strain curve from a tensile test and label the elastic regions, plasitic regions and give a value for youngs modulus.

students will be able to design and tensile test for a given material and predict what the stress vs strain curve will look like. :
