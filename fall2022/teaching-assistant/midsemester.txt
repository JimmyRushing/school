1. I have seen Bloom's taxonomy at work in the course design of MSE 101as well as the evaluation of student success. Our students do not do exexams and instead do a semester long research project on a material of their choosing. From a student evaluation standpoint, this reveals more clearly where in the heirachy a student resides than a test does. From the course design standpoint, this allows a student to hit the ground running from whatever rung of the heirarchy they stand on. This is crucial for a class like MSE 101 which, as I have mentioned before, has softmore business majors researching alongside juniors in mechanical engineering.

2. I think we could integrate more peer evaluation into the semester project. From an operational standpoint, maybe the easiest way would be to anonymize what D , C , B , and A effort look like from semesters pastand have the students grade them and identify whats good or bad about them. My thought is that it is a lot easier to identify what a good project looks like when it is someone elses and it is juxtaposed with weaker projects. My hope is that this will automate some metacognitive engagement with their own projects. Perhaps some of the following metacognitive thoughts may arise: "I would not think about this material like that", "How can I approach this project so as to not produce an obviously inferior product?" "Oh, that's what a concept map is. I was not thinking of it like that."
