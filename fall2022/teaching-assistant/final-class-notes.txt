what was different that expected?
    I guess it was a little more self driven. Perhaps this is a function of  having an entire discussion group. Or a function of TAing for amy. 


what are two pieces of advice for future TAs. 
    be very explicit with your guuidance in the eaerly going of the semester long projects. Assume that they dont know what a material is. And what it means the describe its structure properties etcetera. 

    also be exlpicit with the project aadvice in the early going
