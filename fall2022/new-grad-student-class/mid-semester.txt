1. My students have to do a semester long project on a material of their choice. I think the most useful thing that I have done is showing them in real time how I would find resources and navigate unfamiliar materials jargon. Because I was unfamiliar with many of their specific topics, this showed them how to get started from zero information and graduate that to an understanding of what is going on and how to find recourses. 

2. I observed in real time that experimentation and play are crucial for learning. The most engagment from students came when we got to break some microscope slides and measure the amount of force necessary to break them. This lead to real curiosity about how best to scratch the slides to reduce the flexural strength. This is likely because it feels more autonomous than a lecture or strictly laid out labs. 

3. I would like to learn more about the alternative taxonomical approaches to teaching. This is because Bloom's taxonomy did not resonate with me. My objection to the pedagogy may be semantical. Or maybe I am accustom to viewing things from the learners perspective, as opposed to the teachers perspective. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see some other, less hierarchical, approaches.
