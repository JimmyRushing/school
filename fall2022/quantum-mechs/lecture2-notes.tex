Classical physics over estimates the average energy of short wave length oscillators. 

Temerature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the box.i just like sims duh

Thermal radiation is radiatiion imitted by all matter above 0K. Everything emits light. Human temperautr is low and our thermal radiation

the intensity over wavelength for thermal radiation is a maxwell distribution (basically)

forhead thermometers aka PYROMETER used wiens displacemtent law to relate the wavelength of light to the Temerature of the body. We use the same math to measure the blocl in the MBE. 

doing this assumes that the radiation is a result of thermal radiation.
