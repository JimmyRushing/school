the photo electic effect. Maxwells equations didnt match what was observed of the photoelectric effect. 

When we talk about particles we know where it is (definite location)

when we talk about waves in physics we cant say exactly where it is. It occupies entire dimenenions.

waves can travel in more than one direction. A particle travels in one. 
two particles cannot be in the same place at the same time.

waves can occupy the same points in space and you can get interference (constructive or destuctive). 

particles can be scattered (bouncing off each other). Waves are diffrracted whcih doesnt happen to particles. 

The double slit:
    The extra pathlenght through the farther away slit is d\cdot /sin(/theta). If this distance is an integer number of of the wavelength then it will line up and we will get the same waves basically (constructive interfernce. 

Waves carry energy and we and energy over time is power. this can be a SI unit of watts = J/s. But waves occupy a space. so the energy over ararea is intensity. Therefore intensity as watts/m^2. so how much energy over a given time and area. Inensity is proportianal to the square of the amplitude.
